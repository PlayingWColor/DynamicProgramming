# DynamicProgramming
This is an open ended project I created in Visual Studio to practice dynamic programming with C++. 
The project is split up by dynamic programming problems organized based on the list on Geeks for Geeks. The solutions are my own.

The source must be edited and recompiled for each problem. Insert the Object name of the problem in the main function in main.cpp.
